# [device - Practical Internet of Things with Javascript]

The book "Practical Internet of Things with Javascript by Arvind Ravulavaru" consists of three main parts:
* IoTFW (server)
* dashboard
* device

This is the implementation of the device based on that book.
The book uses a Raspberry Pi device, however we used a LoRa Node v1.0 board to implement a more sofisticated application, to get temperature, humidity and the status of one external high voltage generator (called harp).
